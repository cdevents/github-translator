Please make sure to complete all tasks and check them off once you do, or else your PR will not be merged!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I linked the correct issue in the `### Fixed Issues` section above\r\n- [x] I wrote clear testing steps that cover the changes made in this PR\r\n    - [x] I added steps for local testing in the `Tests` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for the expected offline behavior in the `Offline steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps for Staging and/or Production testing in the `QA steps` section\r\n    - [x] I added steps to cover failure scenarios (i.e. verify an input displays the correct error message if the entered data is not correct)\r\n    - [x] I turned off my network connection and tested it while offline to ensure it matches the expected behavior (i.e. verify the default avatar icon is displayed if app is offline)\r\n    - [x] I tested this PR with a [High Traffic account](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#high-traffic-accounts) against the staging or production API to ensure there are no regressions (e.g. long loading states that impact usability).\r\n- [x] I included screenshots or videos for tests on [all platforms](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/CONTRIBUTING.md#make-sure-you-can-test-on-all-platforms)\r\n- [x] I ran the tests on **all platforms** & verified they passed on:\r\n    - [x] Android: Native\r\n    - [x] Android: mWeb Chrome\r\n    - [x] iOS: Native\r\n    - [x] iOS: mWeb Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Chrome / Safari\r\n    - [x] MacOS: Desktop\r\n- [x] I verified there are no console errors (if there's a console error not related to the PR, report it or open an issue for it to be fixed)\r\n- [x] I followed proper code patterns (see [Reviewing the code](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md#reviewing-the-code))\r\n    - [x] I verified that any callback methods that were added or modified are named for what the method does and never what callback they handle (i.e. `toggleReport` and not `onIconClick`)\r\n    - [x] I verified that the left part of a conditional rendering a React component is a boolean and NOT a string, e.g. `myBool && <MyComponent />`.\r\n    - [x] I verified that comments were added to code that is not self explanatory\r\n    - [x] I verified that any new or modified comments were clear, correct English, and explained \"why\" the code was doing something instead of only explaining \"what\" the code was doing.\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text shown in the product is localized by adding it to `src/languages/*` files and using the [translation method](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60)\r\n      - [x] If any non-english text was added/modified, I verified the translation was requested/reviewed in #expensify-open-source and it was approved by an internal Expensify engineer. Link to Slack message:\r\n    - [x] I verified all numbers, amounts, dates and phone numbers shown in the product are using the [localization methods](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/4bd99402cebdf4d7394e0d1f260879ea238197eb/src/components/withLocalize.js#L60-L68)\r\n    - [x] I verified any copy / text that was added to the app is grammatically correct in English. It adheres to proper capitalization guidelines (note: only the first word of header/labels should be capitalized), and is either coming verbatim from figma or has been approved by marketing (in order to get marketing approval, ask the Bug Zero team member to add the Waiting for copy label to the issue)\r\n    - [x] I verified proper file naming conventions were followed for any new files or renamed files. All non-platform specific files are named after what they export and are not named \"index.js\". All platform-specific files are named for the platform the code supports as outlined in the README.\r\n    - [x] I verified the JSDocs style guidelines (in [`STYLE.md`](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/STYLE.md#jsdocs)) were followed\r\n- [x] If a new code pattern is added I verified it was agreed to be used by multiple Expensify engineers\r\n- [x] I followed the guidelines as stated in the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/contributingGuides/PR_REVIEW_GUIDELINES.md)\r\n- [x] I tested other components that can be impacted by my changes (i.e. if the PR modifies a shared library or component like `Avatar`, I verified the components using `Avatar` are working as expected)\r\n- [x] I verified all code is DRY (the PR doesn't include any logic written more than once, with the exception of tests)\r\n- [x] I verified any variables that can be defined as constants (ie. in CONST.js or at the top of the file that uses the constant) are defined as such\r\n- [x] I verified that if a function's arguments changed that all usages have also been updated correctly\r\n- [x] If any new file was added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] The file has a description of what it does and/or why is needed at the top of the file if the code is not self explanatory\r\n- [x] If a new CSS style is added I verified that:\r\n    - [x] A similar style doesn't already exist\r\n    - [x] The style can't be created with an existing [StyleUtils](https://github.com/Expensify/App/blob/main/src/styles/utils/index.ts) function (i.e. `StyleUtils.getBackgroundAndBorderStyle(theme.componentBG)`)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies code that runs when editing or sending messages, I tested and verified there is no unexpected behavior for all supported markdown - URLs, single line code, code blocks, quotes, headings, bold, strikethrough, and italic.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a generic component, I tested and verified that those changes do not break usages of that component in the rest of the App (i.e. if a shared library or component like `Avatar` is modified, I verified that `Avatar` is working as expected in all cases)\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component related to any of the existing Storybook stories, I tested and verified all stories for that component are still working as expected.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies a component or page that can be accessed by a direct deeplink, I verified that the code functions as expected when the deeplink is used - from a logged in and logged out account.\r\n- [x] If the PR modifies the UI (e.g. new buttons, new UI components, changing the padding/spacing/sizing, moving components, etc) or modifies the form input styles:\r\n    - [x] I verified that all the inputs inside a form are aligned with each other.\r\n    - [x] I added `Design` label and/or tagged `@Expensify/design` so the design team can review the changes.\r\n- [x] If a new page is added, I verified it's using the `ScrollView` component to make it scrollable when more elements are added to the page.\r\n- [x] If the `main` branch was merged into this PR after a review, I tested again and verified the outcome was still expected according to the `Test` steps.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots/Videos\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d12a1eb4-79f2-40eb-991b-4a2e0cc16d8c\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Android: mWeb Chrome</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d501f2b4-ab2b-469c-aa82-6a434d42b5b2\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: Native</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f27cd91-4982-44d7-84de-306a9623691d\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>iOS: mWeb Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb7472f7-4ae0-4b6d-a443-6a495cb8f27f\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Chrome / Safari</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e37331-4050-443a-97ca-c025cb324cea\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>MacOS: Desktop</summary>\r\n\r\n<!-- add screenshots or videos here -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cd326a8-2e24-433e-bf16-355560bf6b82\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

This PR's final implementation is to resolve #17986.**\r\n\r\nA new external type has been introduced, mainly for the purpose of output clean artifact during bundling library. The name of this `\"module-import\"` is referenced from https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/17986#issuecomment-1902096124, but I'm not sure if the current implementation fully meets the intention of this comment. This PR is an incomplete implementation, only implementing the handling of external processing for dynamic imports.\r\n\r\nHere's what it does:\r\n\r\nGiven following config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nexternals: {\r\n  path: 'path node-commonjs',\r\n  fs: 'module-import fs',\r\n  'node:fs': 'module-import node:fs',\r\n  'node-fs': 'module-import fs',\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nsource\r\n```js\r\nit(\"should allow async externals\", async () => {\r\n\tconst fs1 = await import(\"fs\");\r\n\tconst fs2 = await import(\"node:fs\");\r\n\tconst fs3 = await import(\"node-fs\");\r\n\r\n\texpect(fs1).toStrictEqual(fs2);\r\n\texpect(fs1).toStrictEqual(fs3);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput\r\n```js\r\nvar __webpack_exports__ = {};\r\n/*!******************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./index.js ***!\r\n  \\******************/\r\nit(\"should allow async externals\", async () => {\r\n\tconst fs1 = await import(\"fs\");\r\n\tconst fs2 = await import(\"node:fs\");\r\n\tconst fs3 = await import(\"fs\");\r\n\r\n\texpect(fs1).toStrictEqual(fs2);\r\n\texpect(fs1).toStrictEqual(fs3);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a slightly hacky bit here, where we're deleting `ImportDependency` at `finishModules` stage to prevent any runtime code from being generated. But I couldn't find a better way to prevent `ImportDependencyTemplate` from modifying the runtime code. Possibly by introducing a new `DependencyLibraryTemplate` specifically for library patterns could achieve that. Do you have any suggestions on how to suppress runtime code generation? @alexander-akait \r\n\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n\r\nThe PR is still in draft mode, it should add update the document before merged.",

Instead `FileNotFoundError` is raised. This provides consistent user notification of a mis-typed path rather than an unpredictable exception from a file-type specific partitioner when the file cannot be opened.\n-   **EML files specified as a file-path are detected correctly.** Resolved a bug where an EML file submitted to `partition()` as a file-path was identified as TXT and partitioned using `partition_text()`. EML files specified by path are now identified and processed correctly, including processing any attachments.\n-   **A DOCX, PPTX, or XLSX file specified by path and ambiguously identified as MIME-type \"application/octet-stream\" is identified correctly.** Resolves a shortcoming where a file specified by path immediately fell back to filename-extension based identification when misidentified as \"application/octet-stream\", either by asserted content type or a mis-guess by libmagic. An MS Office file misidentified in this way is now correctly identified regardless of its filename and whether it is specified by path or file-like object.\n-   **Textual content retrieved from a URL with gzip transport compression now partitions correctly.** Resolves a bug where a textual file-type (such as Markdown) retrieved by passing a URL to `partition()` would raise when `gzip` compression was used for transport by the server.\n-   **A DOCX, PPTX, or XLSX content-type asserted on partition is confirmed or fixed.** Resolves a bug where calling `partition()` with a swapped MS-Office `content_type` would cause the file-type to be misidentified. A DOCX, PPTX, or XLSX MIME-type received by `partition()` is now checked for accuracy and corrected if the file is for a different MS-Office 2007+ type.\n-   **DOC, PPT, XLS, and MSG files are now auto-detected correctly.** Resolves a bug where DOC, PPT, and XLS files were auto-detected as MSG files under certain circumstances.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - \"after 10pm every weekday,before 5am every weekday,every weekend\" in timezone Asia/Tokyo.\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR becomes conflicted, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n🔕 **Ignore**: Close this PR and you won't be reminded about this update again.\n\n---\n\n - [ ] <!-- rebase-check -->If you want to rebase/retry this PR, check this box\n\n---\n\nThis PR was generated by [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/).

It will scan repositories for package manager files (e.g. from npm/Yarn, Bundler, Composer, Go Modules, Pip/Pipenv/Poetry, Maven/Gradle, Dockerfile/k8s, and many more), and submit Pull Requests with updated versions whenever they are found.\r\n\r\nThis app is free to install for both public and private repositories. Service is provided complimentary of Mend (formerly known as WhiteSource) and no paid plan is required.\r\n\r\n### Intelligent, helpful onboarding\r\n\r\n![Onboarding](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/onboarding.png)\r\n\r\nInstall Mend Renovate risk-free and you'll first receive an onboarding Pull Request in each repository. It analyzes the repository files and describes what will happen next, so there's no surprises. \r\n\r\n### Unopinionated, highly flexible configuration\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"rangeStrategy\": \"pin\",\r\n  \"ignorePaths\": [\"examples/**\"],\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packagePatterns\": [\"^angular.*\"],\r\n    \"groupName\": \"angular\",\r\n    \"automerge\": true\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModify any of Renovate's smart defaults with custom overrides at the repository, package file, dependency type, and package levels. \r\n\r\n### Support for monorepo directory structures\r\n\r\nRenovate will scan all files in each repository to look for relevant package files. It will also group upgrades from the same monorepo into a single PR to ensure tests pass and PR noise is reduced. Natively supports Lerna and Yarn Workspaces with zero configuration necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is also works fine with a mix of package managers / languages within the same repository.\r\n\r\n### Automatic lock file and checksum support\r\n\r\nRenovate will generate updated lock files such as `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` if you're already using them. It will also automatically resolve any conflicts after merges.\r\n\r\n### Ease the noise with custom schedules\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"timezone\": \"America/New_York\",\r\n  \"schedule\": \"before 5am every weekday\",\r\n  \"lockFileMaintenance\": {\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"schedule\": \"after 10pm on sunday\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"packageRules\": [{\r\n    \"packageNames\": [\"aws-sdk\"],\r\n    \"schedule\": \"before 5am every wednesday\"\r\n  }]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThrottle updates however you want with schedules, configurable right down to the per-package level.\r\n\r\n### Rules-based automerging\r\n\r\n![automerging](https://docs.renovatebot.com/assets/images/automerged-pr.png)\r\n\r\nMerge some updates without human intervention if they pass tests and satisfy your automerge rules.",
